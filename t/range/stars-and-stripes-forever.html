        <h1>The Stars and Stripes Forever</h1>

        <h2>By John Philip Sousa</h2>

        <div id="first-strain">
            Let martial note in triumph float
            And liberty extend its mighty hand
            A flag appears 'mid thunderous cheers,
            The banner of the Western land.
            The emblem of the brave and true
            Its folds protect no tyrant crew;
            The red and white and starry blue
            Is freedom's shield and hope.

            Let eagle shriek from lofty peak
            The never-ending watchword of our land;
            Let summer breeze waft through the trees
            The echo of the chorus grand.
            Sing out for liberty and light,
            Sing out for freedom and the right.
            Sing out for Union and its might,
            O patriotic sons.
        </div>

        <div id="second-strain">
            Other nations may deem their flags the best
            And cheer them with fervid elation
            But the flag of the North and South and West
            Is the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.
        </div>

        <div id="trio">
            Hurrah for the flag of the free!
            May it wave as our standard forever,
            The gem of the land and the sea,
            The banner of the right.
            Let despots remember the day
            When our fathers with mighty endeavor
            Proclaimed as they marched to the fray
            That by their might and by their right
            It waves forever.

            May it wave as our standard forever

            The banner of the right.
