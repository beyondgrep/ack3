=head1 COOKBOOK

Here are examples of how to effectively use ack.

Note: on Windows CMD prompt, the quoting may need to switch C<"> for C<'> and/or vice-versa.


=head1 COMPOUND QUERIES

Some compound queries can be done in a single RE pattern but most will require a pipeline command.

=head2 Find "goat(s)" or "cow(s)" or both

    ack '(goats?|cows?)'

=head2 Find "goats" in every file that also contains "cows"

Use command substitution to pass a list of cow files to ack:

    ack goats $(ack -l cows)

Or you can use the program F<xargs> to feed the filenames to the
goat search.

    ack -l cows | xargs ack goats

Or you can use ack's C<-x> option to do the same thing without
having to get F<xargs> involved.

    ack -l cows | ack -x goats

=head2 Find goats in files that do not contain cows

    ack -L cows | ack -x -l goats

=head2 Find "goats" in every farmish file

One of the usual FAQ is how do I use C<< -f pattern1 >> for files
and C< pattern2 > within the files in one command?

The answer is don't, use two C<ack>s, either via a Pipe, or nest them.

   ack -ig 'farm|(?:ei)+o$' | ack -x goats

   ack goats $(ack -ig 'farm|(?:ei)+o$' )

=head2 Find "goats" and "cows" in the same line, either order, as words

Following the  compound is a pipeline trope,
if we assume filenames don't also have goats -

   ack  cows | ack goats

This obviously could scale to N terms, at the cost of N processes.

But for just two, we can easily do it in on go, too:

    ack '\bgoats\b.*\bcows\b|\bcows\b.*\bgoats\b'

C<|> says "OR".

C<< \b >> says word boundary here, letters one side and space or punctuation on the other,
so half of a Whole-words limitation.

C<.*> says anything or nothing, but wrapped in C<\b.*\b> with words on outsides,
will have space or punctuation first and last, unless nothing -- and nothing isn't
allowed, need at least a single space or comma, not C<goatscows>.

=head2 Search for all the files that mention Sys::Hostname but don't match hostname.

    ack -l Sys::Hostname | ack -x -L -I hostname

(We added C<-I> (the reverse of C<-i> or C<< --ignore-case >>)
because we have C<< --smart-case >> on in our C<.ackrc>.
The first C<ack> doesn't need it because smart-case smartly goes case-sensitive when pattern has some UpperCase.
We could have typed C<< --no-smart-case >> but that's too much to type,
so C<-I> on commandline, longform in scripts!)


=head2 Find all goat(s) in files without cows

Search all the files that don't have cow(s) and show their goat(s).

    ack -L 'cows?' | ack -x -w 'goats?'

=head2  Search and highlight a specific pattern 'goat' but exclude lines that match also another pattern 'cow'.

    ack '^(?!.*?cow).*?\Kgoat'

The C<\K> is called KEEP; aside from preventing backtracking, it resets the C<$` $&> boundary, the start of match.
C<(?!.*cow)> is a negative lookahead.
C<.*?> is non-greedy so the search is left to right.

=head2 Simulate a 'to within 5 lines' adverb

     ack -w "$1" -C$n  $dirs | ack -C$n -w "$2" | ack -C$n "$1|$2" --pager='less -r'

Add a C<-h> etc to taste.

=head1 USING ACK EFFECTIVELY

=head2 Use the F<.ackrc> file.

The F<.ackrc> is the place to put all your options you use most of
the time but don't want to remember.  Put all your C<--type-add>
and C<--type-set> definitions in it.  If you like C<--smart-case> and
C<--sort-files>, set them there, too.


=head2 Use F<-f> for working with big codesets

Ack does more than search files.  C<ack -f --perl> will create a
list of all the Perl files in a tree, ideal for sending into F<xargs>.
For example:

    # Change all "this" to "that" in all Perl files in a tree.
    ack -f --perl | xargs perl -p -i -e's/this/that/g'

or if you prefer:

    perl -p -i -e's/this/that/g' $(ack -f --perl)

=head2 Use C<-Q> when in doubt about metacharacters

If you're searching for something with a regular expression
metacharacter, most often a period in a filename or IP address, add
the C<-Q> to avoid false positives without all the backslashing.  See
the following example for more...

=head2 Use ack to watch log files

Here's one I used the other day to find trouble spots for a website
visitor.  The user had a problem loading F<troublesome.gif>, so I
took the access log and scanned it with ack twice.

    ack -Q aa.bb.cc.dd /path/to/access.log | ack -Q -B5 troublesome.gif

The first ack finds only the lines in the Apache log for the given
IP.  The second finds the match on my troublesome GIF, and shows
the previous five lines from the log in each case.

=head2 Use ack instead of find

    ack -f --html --print0 | xargs -0 wc -l

(You may omit the C<< --print0 >> and C<-0> if none of your files or directories contain a space in the name.)

=head2 Searching for a method call

    ack -- '->method'

or

    ack '[-]>method'

(Optionally followed by "word boundary" marker C<\b>
as in  C<< [-]>method\b >> to not find C<< ->methodically >> .)

=head2 Use C<-w> only for words

C<ack -w pattern> will restrict the match to C<pattern> as a word, surrounded by whitespace or punctuation
(and both ends of lines count as whitespace).
(Word means alphabetic or '_' in this context.
If your OS tells Perl that certain accented characters are alphabetic for you, they may be included, try it!)

If your desired pattern begins with one word and ends with another, C<-w> is still safe.

If your desired pattern starts or ends (or both) with punctuation, using C<-w> may be erroneous.  ack will warn you in this case.
If you get a warning about C<-w>, Say What You Mean (SWYM).
If you mean the start of your pattern with punctuation should be
at the beginning of line B<OR> preceded by a word OR by a space (or tab etc), before the needed punctuation,
SWYM as C<(?:^|\b|\s)#+\s+(.*)>
which will find and capture a comment.
(Try it plain, with C<-o>, and with C<--output='$1'>, which has its own section below)

So, don't look for C<ack -w '$identifier'>, as it won't match
C<+$identifier> or C<func($identifier)> and won't even find it in column
1.  Instead, do:

   ack '(?:^|\s|\b)\$identifier\b'

   ack '(?x)(?: ^ | \b | (?<=  \W | \s  )) [#]  DEBUG (?= \b | \s | $) '

SWYMingly finds C<< #DEBUG >> if at beginning of line, after a word break, a non-word char, or a space char,
and followed by a word-break, or space, or end-of-line.
This uses look-behind and look-ahead so that only B<#DEBUG> is highlighted (or saved to C<$&>),
and also C<(?x)> the B<extended> syntax, in which whitespace is only match if explicitly C<\s> or C<\0x20> or C<[ ]>,
the blanks are for readability.

(This is over-specified, since C<G> followed by space would be C<\b>, and C<\s> is C<\W>, but if you're not sure, it's OK to over-specify!)

=head2 See all the C<.vim> files in your hidden C<~/.vim> directory, except in the C<bundle/> directory.

    ack -f --vim ~/.vim --ignore-dir=bundle

=head2 Find all the Ruby files that match /tax/.

   ack -g tax --ruby

Open all the files that have taxes in them.

   vim $(ack -l taxes)

=head2 Find all the Perl test files and test them

Use C<ack>'s file-type inference to find things of C<--type=perltest>
and feed them to C<xargs> so it will run the C<prove> command on them.

     ack -f --perltest | xargs prove

=head2 Find places where two methods with the same name are being called on the same line.

    ack -- '->(\w+).*->\1\b'

The C<< (\w+) >> captures a method name (introduced by C<< -> >> ),
which is then sought a second time as C<\1>, a backreference.
The backreference needs a trailing C<\b> so C<< ->method ... ->methodically >> does not match.
The C<< (\w+) >> needs neither left nor right side C<\b> because the C<+> modifier is greedy, will take all the word chars available.

=head2 Find all the places in code there's a call like C<< sort { lc $a cmp lc $b } >>.

This is a rough heuristic.  It gets false positives, but it's pretty useful.

    ack '\bsort\b.+(\w+).+\bcmp\b.+\b(\1)\b'

The word and backreference are matching the canonicalizing use of C<lc> to lowercase both comparands.

=head2 Show a range of lines in a file

     ack --lines=830-850 filename

And use C<-H> to show what line numbers are.

=head2 Find files that match one string but do not match another.

The module Test::Warn has a number of functions of the form
C<warnings_xxx>.  Look in all the files that find Test::Warn but don't
find the C<warnings_xxx> functions.

    ack -L 'warnings?_' $(ack -l Test::Warn)

=head2 Search only recently changed or 'dirty' files

Most version control systems provide a query to list files changed since checkout, often referred to as 'dirty' files. E.g.,

    alias dirty="git diff --name-only"

    dirty | ack -x pattern

or

    ack pattern $(dirty)

=head2 See just outline of POD in Perl files

    perldoc -o markdown lib/App/Ack/Docs/Cookbook.pm | ack -h '^#+'

Note, this requires L<Pod::Markdown|https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::Markdown> plugin installed.

=head2 TBD Do we need more C<-f> and C<-g> examples?

#TODO

=head1 EXAMPLES OF C<< --output >>

The C<-o> and C<< --output expr >> options allow for specifying and formating the output.

With look-behind and look-ahead, one "match without matching" for highlighting or C<-o>) purposes.
The  regex C<< abc\K(def)(?=ghi) >>  will highlight ONLY C<def> in the text, \
but only if that string is preceeded by C<abc> and C<ghi> follows.
With C<-o>, it will output C<def> but only when found in context of C<abc>B<<C<def>>>C<ghi>.

HT to L<HN|https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15433310>

=head2 Inventory all PHP sqldo functions

Simple C<-o> requests output only what is matched.

    ack 'sqldo_\w+' --php -o -h | sort -u

=head2 Look for a method you're not sure of the name of.

I was looking for a method that I knew was called "something_follows",
so I looked for method invocations like that:

     ack -- '->.+_follows\b'


=head2 Variables for C<< --output >>

Following variables are useful in the expansion string:

=over 4

=item C<$&>

The whole string matched by PATTERN.

=item C<$1>, C<$2>, ... C<$9>

The contents of the 1st, 2nd ... bracketed group in PATTERN.

=item C<$`>

The string before (to the left of) the match.

=item C<$'>

The string after (to the right of) the match.

=back

For more details and other variables see
L<http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html#Variables-related-to-regular-expressions|perlvar>.

This example shows how to add text around a particular pattern
(in this case adding _ around word with "e")

    ack3 "\w*e\w*" quick.txt --output="$`_$&_$'"
    _The_ quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    The quick brown fox jumps _over_ the lazy dog
    The quick brown fox jumps over _the_ lazy dog

This shows how to pick out particular parts of a match using ( ) within regular expression.

    ack '=head(\d+)\s+(.*)' --output=' $1 : $2'
    input file contains "=head1 NAME"
    output  "1 : NAME"

=head2 Find all the headers used in your C programs.

    ack '#include\s+<(.+)>' --cc --output='$1' | sort -u

=head2 Find the most-used modules in your codebase.

    ack '^use ([\w+:]+)' --output='$1' -h --nogroup | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

=head2 Find all the subroutines in Perl tests and then give a count of how many of each there are

     ack '^sub (\w+)' --perltest --output='$1' -h --nogroup | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

=head2 In COBOL source code, match only lines with blank in column 7, ignore

    ack '^.{6}[ ].*?\Kpattern'
    ack '(?x) ^ .{6} [ ] .*? \K pattern'  # same but readable

Again using the C<\K> Keep to reset start of matching.

(Legacy COBOL put C<'*'> in Col 7 for comments, back in punch-card days.
FORTRAN in the day similarly used 'C' or '*' in Col 1.
Early FORTRAN wrapped lines with C<&> in Col 73 and in Col 6 of next line.)

(Hat-tip for Question to Pierre)

=head2 Extract part of a line from a logfile

    ack '>>ip(\S+).+rq"/help' --output='$1' -h

## Fake parsing long JSON

Having a very long line of JSON consisting of bits like

    {"city":"london","first name":"peter","last name":"hansen","age":"40"},
    {"city":"new york","first name":"celine","last name":"parker","age":"36"]

wanting output like

     peter (40) celine (36)

the right way would be to do this is the L<C<jq>|https://stedolan.github.io/jq/> utility - which is sed or ack for JSON. Or write a program. However ... this example, ack can do it.

The sneaky and potentially unreliable way to do it is:

     ack '"first name":"([^"]+)".+"age":"(\d+)"' input.txt --output='$1 $2'

Why unreliable? JSON like Perl makes no guarantee hash keys are in any particular order.

For only two fields, we can use 'alternation' to make it safe:

     ack --output '$1$4($2$3)' '{.*?"first name":"([^"]*)".*?age":"(\d+)|{.*?"age":"(\d+)".*?first name":"([^"]*?)"'

This won't scale well to 3! or greater possible field orders to extract.
At which point, plain Perl with any real JSON module is required.

=head1 VERY ELEGANT ACK

=head2 Open list of matching files in Vim, searching for your search term

     $ ack my_search_term
     <results>
     $ vim $(!! -l) +/!$

=over 4

=item C<!!> expands to the previous command - C<ack my_search_term> in the example

=item C<$(...)> expands to the output of the command in the parens, so the output of C<ack my_search_term -l> in the example

=item C<<  +/<term> >> tells Vim to start searching for C<< <term> >> once it opens

=item C<< !$ >> expands to the last argument of the previous command - my_search_term in the example

=back

Small caveat: Vim patterns and Perl regexes have some overlap, but they are different, so this doesn't work
so well when you have a more complex regex as your search term.
Vim command C<< :help perl-patterns >> will report what Vim thinks the differences are.

=head2 Extending ack your way

A user who really wants the working directory reported makes a C<bash function> (which will look like an alias) to make it so. Hat tip to B<teika-kazura> !

    function ack(){
        local ackLogDir=/tmp/mylogs/Ack
        mkdir -p "$ackLogDir"
        chmod 777 "$ackLogDir" &> /dev/null
        if [[ $# == 0 ]]; then
            find "$ackLogDir" -type f | xargs ls -t |xargs less
            return
        fi
        local f="$( mktemp --tmpdir=$ackLogDir )"
        echo "# Pwd: `pwd`" > $f
        echo "# ack $@" >> $f
        command ack "$@" >> "$f" 2>&1
        less $f
    }

(We can't really recommend C<chmod 777>.  You're better off with per-user temp sub-dirs for security safety,
whether under C<$HOME> or under C</tmp/$USER>.)

=head2 Find log lines with 4 nulls and sort by IP address

Via the L<@clmagic|https://twitter.com/clmagic> "Command Line Magic" Twitter account:

    egrep -- "\t-\t-\t-\t-\t" entries.txt |sort -k3V
    # Get the entries with 4+ null fields and sort the entries by IPv4 (-V) in the 3rd column.

(It's 4+ B<adjacent> null tab-separated fields, null represented as dashes.)

C<ack> will happily do likewise, no changes:

    ack -- "\t-\t-\t-\t-\t" entries.txt |sort -k3V

The difference with C<ack> being, you can use the larger C<perldoc perlre> pattern language,
larger than even C<egrep>'s, to better SWYM DRY (Say What You Mean, and Don't Repeat Yourself):

    ack -- "(?x: \t  (?: - \t ){4} )" entries.txt |sort -k3V

to explicitly count (C<< (?:  ){4} >>) the tab-separated dashes.
The C<< (?x: ) >>  says spaces don't count, are used for readability.
If 'null' was optional spaces between the tabs not a single dash,
we'd use a character class of just space C<< [ ] >>:

    ack -- "(?x: \t  (?: [ ]* \t ){4} )" entries.txt |sort -k3V

(We could use a C<\ > escaped space, but that's hard to read, especially hard to tell if wrong.
Is that one space or two there?)

=head2 Summarize the file-types in your project

    $ ack --noenv --show-type -f | perl -MData::Dumper -naE'++$n{$F[-1]}; END {print Dumper \%n}'
    $VAR1 = {
          'xml' => 32,
          'sql' => 2,
          'shell' => 4,
          'php,shell' => 8,
          'yaml' => 1809,
          'php' => 7122,
          'css' => 360,
          'markdown' => 7,
          'html' => 7,
          '=>' => 1180,
          'json' => 69,
          'js' => 582
        };

=head2 Fetching URLs with ack

In old C<ack2>, Mark Fowler demonstrated the reason that ack3 no longer allows C<--output>
in project-scoped F<.ackrc> files.

In the PerlAdvent calendar
(L<http://www.perladvent.org/2014/2014-12-21.html>), Mark wrote an ack
expression to annotate the URLs found in a file with their download
weights:

    ack2 --output='$&: @{[ eval "use LWP::Simple; 1" && length LWP::Simple::get($&) ]} bytes' \
           'https?://\S+' list.txt
    http://google.com/: 19529 bytes
    http://metacpan.org/: 7560 bytes
    http://www.perladvent.org/: 5562 bytes

C<ack3> restricts C<--output> to using only the safe and sensible variables documented,
and emphatically not code execution via array interpolation.

But you can sill do this, it just requires a pipe --

    ack -o 'https?://\S+' DEVELOPERS.md  \
    |  perl -nl -MLWP::Simple \
                -E 'say "$_ :  @{[ length LWP::Simple::get($_) ]}  bytes";'
    https://github.com/petdance/beyondgrep :  50784  bytes
    https://github.com/petdance/ack3/issues :  111627  bytes

=head2 KWIC: KeyWord in Context index

A Keyword In Context (KWIC) index was more useful in the days of offline
computing and line-printer reports but is still sometimes relevant to
see the matches not (just) highlighted but lined up for easy scanning.

The traditional distinction between KWIC and KWOC is whether the Keyword
is at start of line with it's left context wrapped (KWOC= Out of), or
tab-separated in the middle. KWIC works best with two word-processor
fixed tabsets, not with 8-char tabs, alas.

    ack  --output '$&^I$'"'"'^I|| $`' pattern files | sort     # KWOC
    ack  --output '$&^I$\'^I|| $`'    pattern files | sort     # KWOC

    ack  --output '$`^I$&^I$'"'" pattern files | sort -df -t^I -k F2,F2 # pseudo KWIC
    ack  --output '$`^I$&^I$\''  pattern files | sort -df -t^I -k F2,F2 # pseudo KWIC

(On the KWOC, the C<||> shows where right and left margin are wrapped.)
(To make the KWIC output look right, load into OpenOffice or Word to spread the tab stops !)


=head2 TBD Add Elegant nearly- and not-ugly-and- exact solutions that  require neither hypothetical, C<\n> as OR nor C<--fgrep-f> .

#TODO There are a couple examples above - do we need more ?

=head1 WHEN TO DO SOMETHING ELSE

Sometimes tools in the B<BeyondGrep> family aren't the right tool.

=head2 Json Query C<jq>)

For commandline access to JSON data, L<C<jq>|https://stedolan.github.io/jq/> is utility,
it's like C<sed> or C<ack> for JSON.

=head2 C<comm>: Lines (words) in file1 but not in file2

(Commonly the lines are single words per line.)

While grep can do this

    grep -F -x -v -f file1 file2 > file3

it's rather slow for large files!

The standard Unix/Linux tool for this is C<comm>.
In C<comm> terms, the request is the C<<comm -23 file1 file2>> option.
Wit no args, Column 1 is words only in file1, Columnn 2 is words only in file2,
and Column 3 is words in both files 1 and 2.

The Mnemonic such as it is: C<-23> is C<minus 2,3>,
i.e. omit columns 2 (file 2 words) and 3 (both files words).

One requirement for C<comm> is that files must be sorted by natural sort order.
If the files aren't in nor wanted in sorted order, the shell command or alias needed is

     comm -23 <(sort $file1) <(sort $file2)

with modern C<bash>'s C<< <() >> command substitution as file-pipes.

(That C<< <(fileter $f1) <(filter $f2) >> idiom is also good for pre-filtering input to C<diff> etc.)

Note for Windows users: MicroSoft and CygWin both provide Linux/GNU commandline utilities for Windows.
They may have come with the Perl you're using for Ack.
